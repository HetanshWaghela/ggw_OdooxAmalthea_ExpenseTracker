# Logo Setup Instructions

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: LOGO IS WORKING!

The logo is now successfully implemented and working across the entire application! 

## What's Currently Working:

✅ **Login Page** - Shield logo with currency symbols  
✅ **Register Page** - Shield logo with currency symbols  
✅ **Header Component** - Logo in top navigation  
✅ **Sidebar Component** - Logo in user profile section  
✅ **Loading Spinner** - Logo in loading screen  
✅ **Dashboard** - Logo throughout the application  

## Current Implementation:

The application is using a **temporary SVG logo** that matches your design specifications:
- **Shield shape** with blue-to-green gradient
- **Teal outline** for modern appeal  
- **Euro symbol (€)** in blue circle
- **Dollar symbol ($)** in blue circle
- **Checkmark (✓)** in green circle
- **Circular flow** with arrows connecting symbols

## To Replace with Your Actual Logo:

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.svg` (or `logo.png`) in the `client/public/` folder
2. **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, SVG
3. **Recommended size**: 200x200px or larger for best quality
4. **File name**: Must be exactly `logo.svg` (or update Logo.jsx if using PNG)

## File Structure:
```
client/
├── public/
│   └── logo.svg  ← Currently using temporary SVG (replace with your logo)
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── Logo.jsx  ← Component that loads the logo
```

## How It Works:

The `Logo.jsx` component loads the image from `/logo.svg` and displays it with:
- **Responsive sizing** for different contexts
- **Proper scaling** with `objectFit: 'contain'`
- **Accessibility** with proper alt text
- **Hover animations** preserved from original design

The logo appears in multiple sizes:
- **Loading screen**: 20x20 (large)
- **Login/Register**: 16x16 (medium) 
- **Header**: 10x10 (small)
- **Sidebar**: 8x8 (extra small)

**Your logo is now working perfectly throughout the application!** 🎉
